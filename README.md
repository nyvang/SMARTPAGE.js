#### Javascript library for commonly used JS functions ####

## Functions ##
#### onResizeEnd() 
  - The function is used for resize events, or more specific, when they end.
  - The idea is not to have an event listener that fire´s on every resize event, as this easily can be triggered e.g. 40 times on a single resize.
